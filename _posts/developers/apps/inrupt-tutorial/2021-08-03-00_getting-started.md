# Getting started as a Solid developer

To get started with Solid,
you will need a **Solid Pod** and a **WebID**. You can either use an existing Pod provider or run your own server.

## Using an existing Pod provider {#existing-provider}

You can create a Solid Pod with an existing provider.
For a list of existing Pod providers, see [Solid Pod providers](/users/get-a-pod#get-a-pod-from-a-pod-provider).

## Running your own server {#own-server}

The following **open-source servers** are available, if you want to run your own:

- [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/) for Node.js
- [Node Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server) for Node.js
- [solid-nextcloud](https://github.com/pdsinterop/solid-nextcloud) as a plugin for Nextcloud
- [PHP Solid Server](https://github.com/pdsinterop/php-solid-server) for PHP
- [Manas](https://github.com/manomayam/manas) for Rust

For instructions on:

- Running the Community Solid Server, see [Community Solid Server Readme.md](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer#readme).

- Running the Node Solid Server, see [Node Solid Server Readme.md](https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server/blob/main/README.md).

## Developing your first app

Once you are set up with your own Pod and WebID,
you're ready to develop your own app. Various Solid client libraries may provide a tutorial for beginners; for example, Inrupt offers the [JS Client Library tutorial](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/getting-started/), and O.Team offers the [Solid-React-LDO tutorial](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/blob/main/documentation/solid-react-tutorial.md).
